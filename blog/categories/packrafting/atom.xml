    <id>http://leftbound.com/leftbound/blog/2019/08/13/Anfibio-Fly-Paddle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had been on the lookout for some months for a robust, packable paddle, to match with my rather lightweight <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Universal/Anfibio-Delta-MX::735.html">Anfibio Delta MX</a>. I made some inquiries to few manufacturers of custom paddles, to find out whether it would be possible to source a paddle, for a reasonable cost, that would allow full adjustability and sufficient length for, say, sub 500 grams. Perhaps somewhat a novelty item, with similarly featured paddles already in the market, though ofter rather pricey, weighing only few hundred grams more, it was a fun personal quest.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/48523187046/in/photostream/" title="Delta MX"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48523187046_c27694cd2a_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Delta MX"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Outcome was that customizing some of the currently available carbon paddles, it would be possible to reach, with a reasonable range of adjustments (length-wise) and weights as low as sub 700 grams, but price would become a significant factor. Hence I never pursued getting one put together, but parked the idea and happily kept on paddling with my 5-piece <a href="http://www.paddlesandoars.com">Sawyer</a> paddle.</p>

<p>As it happens, folks at the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/index.php?language=en">Packrafting Store</a>, ever growing the Anfibio line of packrafts and accessories, had also been contemplating with the idea of such a paddle, and this spring launched a new ultralight paddle, especially targeted for their similarly ultralight <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/New/Anfibio-Nano-SL::854.html">Nano SL</a> packraft - the <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Paddle/Ultralight-paddle/Anfibio-Fly::861.html">Anfibio Fly</a>. I was eager to get one in for a trial, as it seemed to have a solid balance of features, weight and cost.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/48523356077/in/photostream/" title="Blade"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48523356077_0643219488_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Blade"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Per the specifications, the Fly is 460 grams light and 49 centimeters short (packed) 5-piece paddle. Adjustable freely for both in length, between 178 and 210 centimeters, and for the feathering (blade angle), it packs a punch for those anyone looking for a versatile tool for packing and paddling out with minimal bulk and weight.</p>

<p>With a slimmed down shaft, 24 millimeters in diameter, it still sits well in hand, even for a guy like me with rather long fingers. I had my doubts initially especially about this, but during the few months of using the paddle, I&rsquo;ve never experienced or noticed any discomfort, and quickly got used to this narrower shaft.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/48523185936/in/photostream/" title="Spring Lock"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48523185936_c5e5a25878_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Spring Lock"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Blades are made of nylon, which, as opposed to crafting those from carbon fibre, assume help tremendeously in keeping not just the weight, but also the price at an acceptable level. Blades do flex quite a bit if pulling by hand, which is expected, but are robust and I&rsquo;ve not felt I&rsquo;d need to watch over them (and I haven&rsquo;t). Their shape gives a solid purchase in water, and while there is some flex, it doesn&rsquo;t have a noticeable impact on the overall &ldquo;performance&rdquo; of the paddle - do remember that this is an ultralight paddle not comparable with any real performance-oriented paddles. I lended the paddle over to my friend with extensive experience on kayak paddling, and paddles, and while he did pay attention more than myself to the flex, he agreed it felt solid and robust for such a lightweight paddle.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/48523353822/in/dateposted/" title="Flexing"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48523353822_0a1d1f43a0_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Flexing"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As the shaft is fully adjustable in length and for the feather, there isn&rsquo;t any real shortcomings when it comes to multi-use of paddles in general. I use mine as a center pole for my pyramid tent (<a href="https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/products/ultamid-4-ultralight-pyramid-tent">Ultamid 4</a>), where the 178 to 210 centimeter range is perfect for a fully adjustable pitch in different weather conditions. In water, I use nothing but the maximum, as it gives me the most comfortable reach over the tubes - your mileage may vary, also depending on the tube size, seat height and personal dimensions. It would be nice to have the feathering angles etched into the ferrule lock (or at least 30 and 60 degree marks in it), but that&rsquo;s a minor detail that&rsquo;s easy to add yourself, if you miss them.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/48523185546/in/photostream/" title="Locking mechanism"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48523185546_f0613f09ce_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Locking mechanism"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The spring locks connecting the shafts and the blades are well positioned, and there is sufficient overlap to create a solid connection that does not induce unnecessary flex and ensures longevity. And luckily all parts are fully interchangeable (except of course for the middle piece with the locking mechanism), so you won&rsquo;t be annoyed pushing two parts together only to notice that part is wrong way around or needs to be connected to that OTHER blade you&rsquo;re not holding.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/48523354377/in/photostream/" title="Overlap"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48523354377_74bb7c7259_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Overlap"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>During the extended use over few months, including pushing against the wind through the coastal swell in the archipelago, paddles through rivers and small streams and crossing lakes, this paddle has performed without trouble, and I cannot think of anything I&rsquo;d change.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/48523416452/in/album-72157710270063196/" title="Just chillin&#x27;"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48523416452_d21085a375_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Just chillin&#x27;"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As it is, Fly is a solid choice to complete packable and lightweight packrafting kit, and will work as a charm also as a backup paddle (which you should always bring on an extended excursion or expedition). Bundled with a lightweight (or an ultralight) packraft, such as the Delta MX I have, and perhaps a <a href="https://www.packrafting-store.de/Safety/Anfibio-Buoy-Boy::499.html">Buoy Boy</a> PFD I myself use, it brings you back to the origins of packrafts as portable, but not heavily performance-oriented vessels, for boundaryless exploration.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I consider packraft as one of the most, if not the most, rewarding investments into outdoor gear I have ever made. Typically when jumping into a new hobby, it would be great to have the opportunity to try it out, to see if it fits, before going full monty. But I have a habit of getting involved in niche activities, and back in 2011, packrafting was exactly that. Though gaining momentum in US, there was no local community or any retailer in Europe, though rumor had it there were few rafts already imported to Finland. Stoked about fatbikes as well, I watched videos from Alaska and read about adventurers bikepacking in, and using rafts to traverse, the wilderness, sometimes combining the two. And I tried not to pull the trigger.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30059059194/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Top view"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5753/30059059194_16e4762102_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Top view"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My paddling experience prior to owning a packraft was close to non-existent. I had paddled a bit with a canoe, <a href="https://vimeo.com/31107186">running down flooding rivers with a friend</a>. But living in a block of flats, I had no room to store a canoe or a kayak of my own. Running across these little vessels online, I was immediately intrigued, as I saw the potential with storability and portability of such rafts. At the time, <a href="http://www.alpackaraft.com">Alpacka Raft</a> was pretty much the only feasible option, especially for a guy my size, with only one other company in the market, offering slightly more fragile, but also a bit more lightweight rafts for standard-sized paddlers. As packrafts were raising some interest within Europe, I managed to hook up with two guys from Germany, for a group order of rafts and accessories from Alpacka Raft. These guys later established the first European store for packrafting gear, the <a href="http://www.packrafting-store.de">Packrafting Store</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30653984286/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Bottom view"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5770/30653984286_5d01b4e843_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bottom view"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Exactly 5 years have now passed since I placed the order and few weeks later unpacked a shipment of a Alpacka Raft Llama and a beautiful 5-piece <a href="http://www.paddlesandoars.com">Sawyer</a> paddle, made specifically for packrafting. Ordering a relatively expensive raft just based on videos and reports online, I had opted for a version without a spray deck, to cut some of the cost. I also had no plans to do any white water, and felt I could get by without it just fine. Cost of the optional spray deck was at the time around 250 EUR, while the raft and the paddle together were around 1000 EUR, delivered.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30390835560/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Packraft, bike and paddle"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5339/30390835560_ced7f393b5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Packraft, bike and paddle"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My concerns whether I had made a bad call, purchasing one blindly, quickly evaporated, as I inflated the raft and started exploring the nearby rivers and lakes, and the Baltic Sea archipelago. It quickly became a go-to tool for majority of my outdoor endeavors. Winter in between, once spring floods arrived, against my initial plans, I did venture into rapids and white water, and quickly realized the importance of some sort of spray deck. I also started to see benefits of such for <a href="http://leftbound.com/blog/2012/09/13/Wet-But-Not-Miserable/">paddling through persistent rain</a>. Hence I ended up selling the raft on the verge of summer, and ordering a new one with a Cruiser spray deck. And, as I could get a very good deal with the raft on a new, reinforced version of the Sawyer Paddle, I also upgraded that with no loss. Total cost of an Alpacka Raft with a spray deck and a Sawyer Paddle (plus some spares and kit) was 1300 eur - this was in May 2012. At the time, Alpacka was doing quite significant remodeling on their packrafts. The latest model I received, sported the extended stern which added stability in rapids and made the raft track much better especially on flats. Compared to the earlier versions, also the bow was more pointed and slightly upturned, which helped the same, with minimal weight penalty.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30059036994/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Side view"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5464/30059036994_e39a98360f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Side view"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>During the 4+ years I&rsquo;ve had this marvelous vessel, it&rsquo;s been a trustworthy tool for plenty of adventures and an enabler for a whole lot of new experiences. It has been <a href="http://leftbound.com/blog/2016/09/06/Paddling-Isoj%C3%A4rvi-National-Park/">paddled on calm lakes</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/43413294">maneuvered through meandering rivers</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/91388048">splashed through white water</a> and slid over countless of submerged rocks. It has been <a href="https://vimeo.com/51874572">dragged through bush</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/90956519">over obstacles on land and on water</a>. It&rsquo;s been stood on, sat on, slept on, and it&rsquo;s been scraped, scratched, poked and punctured. It&rsquo;s been loaded with gear, it has <a href="http://leftbound.com/blog/2012/06/29/Bikerafting-In-Suvisaaristo/">carried bicycles</a>, it has been used as a sled in the winter, and it has been pulled across a lake by a large pike. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://vimeo.com/102656099">sailed with it</a>, capsized it and relied on it, without any concerns.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30390799850/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Scuffs"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5637/30390799850_c1d560df92_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scuffs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With packrafts gradually gaining popularity, getting into packrafting is much easier today than it was some four, five years ago. Plenty of local and regional communities, many with Facebook presense, provide forums to discuss and learn. Increasing popularity of packrafting has also bred new companies and original designs, but sadly, also copycats. As Ron Bell from Mountain Laurel Designs just the other day <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/MountainLaurelDesigns/permalink/10154656962682726/?comment_id=10154663498692726&amp;notif_t=group_comment_reply&amp;notif_id=1477834077879702">meritoriously called in the company&rsquo;s Facebook page</a>, copying is a problem that often goes beyond the debate of global trade, ethical and legal discussions or intellectual property rights as, and this applies very much also to packrafts, it can also be a matter of personal safety. The prices I have listed in this blog post serve a purpose of highlighting the fact that when I made my purchase, prices were significantly cheaper (some 30% or so, likely due to increase in material and labour cost and the USD exchange rates), close to what you today need to pay for a Chinese raft.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30059027164/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Scuffs"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5339/30059027164_450c3dac95_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scuffs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now, whether any of the available mimics of Alpacka Raft&rsquo;s packrafts are of inferior quality or not, I cannot attest, as I have no personal experience on them. And hence I leave it to that. But what I can say, from the experience with Alpacka&rsquo;s, the quality and reliability of these packrafts are second to none. Despite the continuos heavy use, my Llama has no significant damage, and any wear and tear seen also in the photos here is plainly cosmetic. Being a lightweight vessel, initially holding it in my hands, I was almost certain it would not survive long, and that I, as a person who does not pamper gear, would quickly wear it out, or break it, beyond reasonable repair. I was obviously proven wrong, and as of now would not hesitate to recommend these rafts to anyone interested in getting into packrafting. And should I ever need to replace my raft, I would be strongly inclined to purchase another Alpacka Raft. Since my purchase, they have further lengthened the stern and also offer the innovative Cargo fly as an option. Neither of these induce gear aquisition syndrome for me, but could tip the scale for someone else.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30602569021/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Scuffs"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/6/5727/30602569021_c306184167_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scuffs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A given product is rarely a perfect fit for everyone, as we all have our own preferences and priorities for gear we use. Of course, some products also have flaws that anyone can (and will) agree upon. Where for some user a given feature is mandatory or considered working perfectly, for another user that same feature can be redundant or seen as flawed and unusable. While the Llama has proven to be a great product for its intended use, and I am overly satisfied with it, there are few caveats I hope Alpacka Raft would address in some way, going forward.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30602659211/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Inflation bag and valve cap"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5754/30602659211_9ab9f79ff3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Inflation bag and valve cap"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>First one would be the inflation bag and the large valve on the raft. Most of the people using inflation bags, based on what I&rsquo;ve discussed, end up having the supporting struts (on mine they were made of bamboo) ripping through the sleeves quite quickly. I continued to repair mine, sewing them in over and over again, and finally ditched them completely. The inflation bag actually doesn&rsquo;t really require them, as one can still inflate the raft relatively easy. But I would still like to see some improvement there. When I forgot the bag home once this summer, huffing and puffing through the small valve to inflate the raft, I played with an idea of an integrated inflation bag, that would be screwed in to the valve and stored stuffed inside the raft. This would require a larger valve and some minor engineering with nested threads, but Alpacka Raft, if you read this, feel free to look into that option!</p>

<p>A more notable inconvenience is the raft&rsquo;s main valve, or actually the cap on it. While the nozzle on the inflation bag threads easily on the main valve, the cap refuses to thread easily and every time it&rsquo;s an unnecessary struggle to try to screw in the cap fast, without loosing at least few puffs worth of air. It&rsquo;s been like this from the very beginning, so it&rsquo;s not simply worn out. Turning the cap first counter clockwise helps a notch, but it is really no match made in heaven, valve and the cap. Inconvenient at most, better cap would still be very welcome.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30602658541/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Valve and cap"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/6/5665/30602658541_ded8e82b80_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Valve and cap"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Second one is about bottom wear. While the standard width and length of the bottom, made out of more robust material than the tubes themselves, is perfectly acceptable, in my own experience I would extend it backwards quite a bit, as the stern gets pretty beaten up. Again, this has not caused a failure yet, but just thinking of maximum longevity, I would appreciate it. It has also to do with the way you enter the raft, since wet entries would not cause any extra stress on bottom of the stern. I however do almost exclusively dry entries (and exits), which means often a loaded raft, with me and gear, gets slid down a river bank or a waterfront rock or a cliff, often scraping the bottom of the stern against ground, sometimes above water, at least momentarily. With repetitive touch downs, there is some visible wear, though no leaks or holes. But in order to prevent further damage, I have now, since this summer, addedd few rows of Gorilla tape on the stern, as shown in the photo below.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30653987436/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Stern"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5510/30653987436_e918d166ec_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stern"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Third one is a bit more complicated. As I mentioned, I upgraded my Llama in 2012 from a <a href="https://vimeo.com/32149186">barebone raft</a> to a one with a Cruiser spray deck, attached with two zippers and a velcro strip. When I decided I want to have some weather and splash protection after all, I opted for the Cruiser, instead of the Whitewater version, as I wanted to have the option for an open boat. This was smart call, as I&rsquo;ve for example paddled with my daughter when she was younger, and could easily fit us two, something that wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible with a Whitewater deck. Same goes for fishing, I like it fully open there as well.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30573814552/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Rigged for fishing"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5737/30573814552_3d4a84921d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rigged for fishing"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Llama is a snug fit for me and I can just straighten my legs when seated without shoes and the backrest I never use. Opting for the Whitewater deck would have required me to customize the boat, adding some 10 centimeters to its length. Over the years, also capsizing the boat in safe environment to learn how to exit from the raft in case of emergency, I have grown less and less reliant on it, mainly trusting it for flatwater paddling in the rain, where it works reasonably well. In rapids, I am always concerned of capsizing and not being able to pull the velcro open, and even when sealed as tight as possible (purpose of having the deck), water always seeps in, as waves and splashes flow over the deck. So it remains a mixed bag for me. I don&rsquo;t however have any feasible suggestions on how to improve it, and I do understand its limitations for white water, that&rsquo;s where the Whitewater deck reigns. For now, my priorities and preferences for boating support having an open boat that I can cover with the removable deck when needed, even if it&rsquo;s not perfect. So this is not a deal breaker for me.</p>

<p>Not a caveat, but worth mentioning - I use an elevated seat, which gives me superior ergonomics over the standard seat. Mine is a simple inflatable seat from Thermarest (NeoAir) which I bought second-hand, on a whim, and turned out to be a keeper. Patched up thrice over two years or so, it&rsquo;s not overly delicate, but for example fish hooks and such easily puncture it. If the raft would have attchment points for the standard seat some 5-7 centimeters higher (or have that much larger seat), I would happily leave this accessory behind.</p>

<p>This was my personal take on these little chubby boats, hope it gives you some ideas what to expect, and answers some of the questions or concerns you might have. If not, feel free to drop a question below, or contact me directly, I am happy to assist in any way I can, for smooth entry into a new hobby. If you&rsquo;re from Finland, and capital area, I am happy to offer a demo, should that help to decide which size or which accessories would suite you best. As a photo is worth a thousand words and video is thousands of photos, I&rsquo;ve hyperlinked both in the text, from the trips I&rsquo;ve made over the years, to give you some idea what the raft can handle and support.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/30653957356/in/album-72157674539387211/" title="Scuffs"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5632/30653957356_53d8d58003_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scuffs"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Although at least here in Finland the season is gradually coming to an end, though not just yet, I felt the timing is good, to plant the seed for the next season. I also did get my first raft in November, you see. Should this post got you interested in Alpacka&rsquo;s rafts but left you pondering about finances, I remind you that Alpacka Raft has typically had a Christmas sale in November-December, shaving off 10% or more, which might help you to decide to what to invest.</p>

<p>As the communities are growing, there starts to be also a reasonable second-hand market for packrafts and packrafting related gear. To try to consolidate that, few weeks ago I took an initiative and opened a global <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/154741864976536/?fref=ts">Sell &amp; Buy group in Facebook</a>. This I hope proves to be useful for anyone looking to save some money or to sell gear no longer needed. At this moment, there are several rafts available within US and Europe, and other good deals on related gear.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend the annual packraft gathering took place in southern Finland. Now third year in running, it pulled together around 15 paddlers over the course of the weekend, a highest number so far, with several first timers and lots of new faces. As opposed to <a href="http://leftbound.com/blog/2015/11/19/Packraft-Gathering/">last year&rsquo;s lake hopping in HelvetinjÃ¤rvi National Park</a>, this time the event was kicked off in <a href="http://www.kytaja-usmi.fi">KytÃ¤jÃ¤-Usmi</a> outdoor area in HyvinkÃ¤Ã¤, and took the colorful flock of paddlers down the river Vantaanjoki, all the way to Myllykoski, and a few, even beyond.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29838062175/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Colors of packrafting"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8307/29838062175_c568bb7162_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Colors of packrafting"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Unfortunately, for me, come the week of the event, I managed to pull something on my left shoulder, playing sporty games at my daughter&rsquo;s school camp I was supervising, and had to make a tough call of bailing out from the longish paddled down the river, and simply join the kick-off at lake Piilolammi in KytÃ¤jÃ¤-Usmi, to meet the fellow paddlers and to try catch some fish. Launch was preceded by a simple workshop we had put together with Marko, discussing the few intricacies of fishing from a packraft, and preparing simple line and a hook systems to use with earthworms or bait fish. Although lake offered no catch for the minimalist fishermen, a dark-hued pike was eventually caught in the group, and prepared by the fire.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29724989062/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Pikey dinner being prepared"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8514/29724989062_9a2d08e82e_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Pikey dinner being prepared"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Some of us, yours truly included, had relied on catching some protein from the lake, so the lone catch quickly disappeared from the pan, with some fried onion and chopped sheep polypore (&lsquo;lampaankÃ¤Ã¤pÃ¤&rsquo;), harvested from the surrounding forest, as a side dish. I had mistakenly assumed there would be a lean-to at the lake, so without any shelter with me, I laid my sleeping bag by the fire, bivvying under the cloudy skies, perfectly warm and cozy through the relatively warm autumn night.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29838065235/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Journey begins"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8492/29838065235_2c880726a2_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Journey begins"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Next morning I tried again to catch some perch for breakfast but the lake, rich in humus, still provided none, so porridge it was. The merry team of packrafters then packed up, few heads stronger, and hit the road, hiking to a nearby tributary, for an early launch towards Vantaanjoki. Left behind by my own choise, I had opted to explore the area on a bike, and packing up with day&rsquo;s supplies and fishing gear, I hit the trails soon after, with a rough plan for a round trip through the forest roads and trails.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29755491901/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Faster!"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8345/29755491901_d55fccbeeb_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Faster!"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Day remained cloudy and comfortably cool, while I roamed in the park on my fatbike, visiting several lakes, including MÃ¤kiperÃ¤nlampi, Kiiskilampi, Iso KypÃ¤rÃ¤, Kaksoislammit and UsminjÃ¤rvi. Of these, the middle three have a lean-to in them, and especially the ones in Kiiskilampi and Kaksoislammit are well positioned with great views. A smart approach in my opinion, the firewood supplies, which there are many, were always positioned some distance away from the lean-to&rsquo;s and fireplaces, requiring a bit of effort to keep the fire going.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29210839154/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Woody supply"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8393/29210839154_d3af583fba_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Woody supply"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Not so smart choice were the oddly sized lean-tos, sized to accommodate only three people at a time, with anyone over 160 cm tall having to sleep in parallel to the doorway, effectively blocking the way for others sharing the shelter. A 195 cm tall myself, it was not a match made in heaven, as head or feet first is generally the best way to share a lean-to shelter.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29545303730/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Too tall, or too small?"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8551/29545303730_7b91349198_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Too tall, or too small?"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I took my time to enjoy the views, to stop here and there, and of course to try catch some fish, as my lunch was mainly dependent on that. Lakes remained silent, which has to do with, if not only my luck, or skills, the specific time of the year and the northerly winds. Regardless, no protein from the lake, but I did have a few slices of buckwheat bread with garnish in my pack and shared a sausage by the fire at Iso KypÃ¤rÃ¤, offered by a friendly couple finishing up their lunch. If the nature does not provide, a kind passer-by just might! Though I did find some more mushrooms and of course plenty of harvest-ready lingonberries and some overdue bilberries.</p>

<p>The park had just recently received brand new sign-posts all around, which made it super easy to navigate through, with directions and distances carved in each colorful pole. These however were only along the gravel and forest roads, so once on the trails, a general sense of direction, and at times a map of the area, was needed for navigation.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29210829804/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Signpost"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8270/29210829804_e08d19b26f_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Signpost"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I finished my tour nearby lake Piilolammi, where my car was parked, and guestimating the group just might be done soon with their roughly 20 kilometers of paddling down the river, I deciced to, instead of heading directly home, visit them at the next stop, at Nukarinkoski rapids. Turning up around six in the evening to the lean-to, the group had indeed shortly arrived. Similar to few others joining the event, I hadn&rsquo;t had high expectations on the surroundings of Vantaanjoki, and having to skip the long paddle had not been a huge disappointment. However, as I got to hear around the camp fire, the river had an ace or two up in its sleeve, and the day had not only been a long strenuous paddle with a good mileage for slow packrafts, but spotted with interesting views and passing attractions.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29210838154/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="The nest"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8531/29210838154_766373f1a8_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="The nest"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While the easy rapids down the line had been rock-hopping gardens due to very low water levels, and the big ones at Nukarinkoski (largest of them all along Vantaanjoki), and next day at Myllykoski, unpaddleable again due to insufficient discharge, they had made the days more interesting and also revealed some good potential for a revisit in the future. I bid farewell again to the team at the night fall, heading home with few others, while the remaining packrafters were looking forward to the next day&rsquo;s paddle.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Few years ago, we kicked off a continuous roll of overnighters, something we call &lsquo;Outdoor Monthly&rsquo;, as a loose group of friends who enjoy outdoors. Initially, we planned for reasonable one night (or one trip, that could be few nights in duration) per month schedule, but despite the best efforts, we haven&rsquo;t been able to do it every single month. But it&rsquo;s the idea and the effort that counts, right, and each month we do our best to make it happen, on top of other activities each of us do on our own.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/28856995454/in/dateposted/" title="Morning fog"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8506/28856995454_65eb4d65fb_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Morning fog"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Last weekend, after a short break over the summer months (the typical gap we seem to have each year), we had our 33rd event. Dates set, we agreed we would visit the <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/isojarvi/">IsojÃ¤rvi National Park</a> near Kuhmoinen, and as the park gets its name off its large lake, we chose paddling as the activity.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29447356256/in/album-72157670237974603/" title="Chasing the rain"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8261/29447356256_fcb0fa8da2_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Chasing the rain"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Amongst the five of us joining for this outing, we had an array of lake-worthy tools to put down in Nokipohja, where we arrived on Friday evening - A single kayak, a family canoe to carry two, a lightweight kevlar canoe for one, and a packraft for me. As I certainly had the slowest of the vessels, I also brought my WindPaddle Adventure sail, to cruise along as the wind and its direction would match our path - and luckily it did!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/28859605943/in/photostream/" title="WindPaddle"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8311/28859605943_d0a6dcfd6c_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="WindPaddle"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>IsojÃ¤rvi National Park, about 23 square kilometers in size, is situated mainly south of lake IsojÃ¤rvi, but extends also to the north, and includes several separate nature reserves. There are roughly 30 kilometers of marked trails, 4 lean-to&rsquo;s and two separate fire places. As we chose to explore the park paddling, we only visited one of the lean-to&rsquo;s, where we also stayed overnight, in the small island of Renusaari.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29192914170/in/album-72157670237974603/" title="Islands"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8677/29192914170_642cd37004_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Islands"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>A perfect spot to camp out, the lean-to was built right next to the lake, with a view towards the setting sun. Water in IsojÃ¤rvi is very clear and the lake is good to drink from - boil it if in doubt. Paddling to Renusaari, potatoes, onions and dill in my pack, I hoped to catch some perch to make a soup, but I only caught one, so I had to resort to my plan B, fish soup turned into a reindeer meat stew - delicious nevertheless!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/28856993754/in/photostream/" title="Round the fire"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8748/28856993754_3f6434cb02_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Round the fire"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On Saturday, we paddled around the north side of the lake IsojÃ¤rvi, going in and out and in between the small islands and islets, enjoying the summery weather and relaxed paddling. I continued to fish, and even got a glimpse of a large pike underneath my raft, but throughout the day caught nothing.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29192904040/in/album-72157670237974603/" title="Transparency"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8150/29192904040_9e1839703b_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Transparency"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We stopped in one of the scenic small islands with large boulders that were characteristic for this wilderness-like lake, serrated by the breakage of earth crust. It is this what also makes some of the trails in the area tough to hike through, with high cliffs and boulderfields to negotiate.</p>

<p>Fish was hiding from us, but we saw a common crane swooping over the lake, and listened the barks and cackles of red-throated divers (Kaakkuri) at the night fall, as we gazed over the starry sky. Night was clear and a bit chilly, though I slept comfortably in the lean-to, sheltered from the wind by my packraft, hung up at the entrance.</p>

<p>Cowberries were ripe, and were a perfect add-on to the morning porridge. I cannot eat grain, so mine is made of full grain rice which makes a good substitute. I had finished my year-long relaxed project of carving a &lsquo;kuksa&rsquo; by hand from a birch gnarl just before the trip, and could now use it for the first time outdoors - coffee tasted even better than usual!</p>

<p>As the wind was present most of the time, I was able to use the sail quite a bit, and also lend it to others to try out, as it&rsquo;s a neat little tool for any small vessel. I had my keel (leeboard-style, a simple plexiglass board hung on the lee side), so could travel down the wind at an angle, which is useful when touring. Weather stayed clear and despite we got a few drops of rain on the first evening, when landing to our campsite, we got really lucky with the weather - it got downright hot at times during the day, sun blazing, though already at a lower angle.</p>

<p>I hope to return some day to explore also the network of trails around the area, but for now, this was a great first visit, and despite the longish drive from Espoo, well worth it. As usual, browse to <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/isojarvi/">Luontoon.fi</a> for a map and other details of the area.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To continue a tradition of an annual packraft gathering, <a href="http://korpijaakko.com/2014/08/27/the-first-finnish-packrafting-gathering/">premiered last year</a>, come this autumn primus motor of the first event, <a href="https://twitter.com/korpijaakko">Korpijaakko</a>, kicked off the preparations early on and soon after <a href="http://korpijaakko.com/2015/08/30/the-second-finnish-packraft-gathering/">the second get-together was agreed</a> over the weekend of September 18 to 20.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/28996266236/in/album-72157671604949732/" title="Pushing into the wind"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7559/28996266236_a79dea9904_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Pushing into the wind"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>With packrafting slowly gaining popularity also here in Finland, I was hoping for a decent participation rate, despite the usual timing-related challenges with a large group, and invitations were sent all around, and event pitched in social media, such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/packrafting/?fref=ts">Facebook</a> and Twitter. Sharing a ride from Espoo with <a href="https://twitter.com/mtakanen">Marko</a>, we were happy to meet seven other paddlers on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Haukanhieta-Helvetinj%C3%A4rven-kansallispuisto/439138099440997">campsite in Haukanhieta</a>. Preparing a late dinner and downing few beers, we discussed about the possible options for the next day&rsquo;s activities, and while the drafted original plan had us heading down the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wL4gBc-SRU">Haukkajoki river</a>, with some insight from a local packrafter, discouraged by the low water levels, a new plan was made. Instead of heading down the river, we would instead do a lake-hopping tour, returning to this same campsite by the lake HaukkajÃ¤rvi at day&rsquo;s end.</p>

<p>Saturday dawned sunny but windy. Prepared with fishing gear, we decided with Marko to head out on the lake, early in the morning, to try and catch some surf (perch or pike) for our turf (bacon). While I was catching nothing, Marko did manage to pull up a couple of fair-sized pikes, and we had our fried breakfast with some extra protein - delicioso!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/28924030992/in/album-72157671604949732/" title="Passing an islet"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8421/28924030992_9fb635e5b5_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Passing an islet"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Closing noon, with our merry group now two paddlers stronger, it was time to go, and see what the national park had to offer for us, most being in the area for the very first time. Heading out on the lake again, we started with a push into the headwind, out from the sandy shores of Haukanhieta. While I had been looking forward to the river, with some easy rapids, and a larger one in the end, to negotiate, with a large group of ours, it was actually very nice to glide across the lake, chatting and basking in the sun. Lake-hopping is surely a great way to utilize the ultimate portability of these rafts, and we kept a relaxed pace throughout the day.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29029133705/in/album-72157671604949732/" title="Towards Helvetinkolu"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8208/29029133705_3d87a41bea_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Towards Helvetinkolu"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Our route around the park passed through seven lakes and ponds: KetvenjÃ¤rvi and VÃ¤hÃ¤ketven, Iso HelvetinjÃ¤rvi, Sammakkolammi, Pikku HelvetinjÃ¤rvi, PitkÃ¤ HelvetinjÃ¤rvi and Luoma, our point of exit. In each one, I tried catching some perch for dinner, but throughout the day just couldn&rsquo;t get any, not a single bite. But this did not matter all too much, as fishing on this trip was simply a way to kill time and relax, and Marko again kept the situation under control and brought food on the dinner table, catching two more beautifully copper-hued pikes.</p>

<p>Until <a href="https://www.google.fi/maps/place/Helvetinkolu/@62.0541773,23.8285129,16.43z/data=!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x468f4c5a9d72dc7d:0xb28575da9f2fdd98!2sHelvetinj%C3%A4rven+kansallispuisto!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x2cc13d45863e975d">Helvetinkolu</a> (a famous dry canyon at the western end of Iso HelvetinjÃ¤rvi, barely visible from the lake except for the majestic cliff at the exit) paddling and hiking was simple and clean, although we did collect a reasonable amount of deer flies on the way, crawling in every nook and grannie. Continuing from there, we found ourselves working slightly harder, first passing through a bog following a meandering ditch that was possible to paddle only for first few tens of meters, then hopping over and under fallen trees, and circumnavigating random obstacles. At the last lake, before the final leg of our paddle, I noticed my fishing rod with reel, carefully stashed two-fold inside of packraft during the day&rsquo;s hikes, pulling the raft behind me, had fallen out, and was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/28924032282/in/album-72157671604949732/" title="Bushwhacking"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8454/28924032282_ea120ed4f6_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Bushwhacking"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Flabbergasted, I was sure it was lost for good, but Marko providing company, and an extra pair of eyes, a hike back to the previous lake was done, trying to locate the earthy-colored combo in the bushes. Against the odds, we did locate it eventually, having fallen out on a soggy leg half way up from the previous lake, and with a relief, fully equiped again, we headed back to our rafts, to catch up with the rest of the group, already preparing late lunch on the shores of lake <a href="https://www.google.fi/maps/place/Luoma,+Ruovesi/@62.0441753,23.8657131,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x468f4da56cd142fd:0x9e08ab04f7243d0a">Luoma</a>.</p>

<p>After lunch, we deflated the rafts, packed up, and headed back to the campsite along the dirt roads, just on time before the darkness fully fell. We then had to bid farewell to few of the fellow packrafters who could not stay for another night, and with a smaller group a round of steamed pike and other delicacies were consumed around the campfire, before the night fell.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/28924030252/in/album-72157671604949732/" title="Across a lake"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8231/28924030252_fb6d4d06f1_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Across a lake"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Next day, while finishing breakfast (thanks for the bag of chanterelles <a href="https://twitter.com/HikeVentures">Konstantin</a>, they perfected our scrambled eggs in the morning!), we decided with Jaakko and Marko to go take a peek at the Haukkajoki river, where the road meets the Karhukoski rapid. On site, hiking up to the <a href="http://www.laavu.org/kohde.php?id=1085">lean-to</a> at the start of the roughly 300-meter long meandering rapid, the river did not actually look all that bad, though shallow indeed. Not wanting to miss out a small piece of action, Jaakko having to head towards home, with Marko we decided to raft down the Karhukoski rapid. A rocky and narrow channel, dropping down to the rapid led us through plenty of maneuvers around and over surfacing rocks and occasional grounding was inevitable. Next time around, at high water, Haukkajoki is definitely on the to-do list!</p>

<p>This was a fun weekend with like-minded paddlers, and as always, it was nice to meet new faces and catch up with few old ones. Most definitely this tradition needs to continue, and during the weekend there was also some discussion on whether there could be room for more get-togethers throughout the season - stay tuned!</p>
