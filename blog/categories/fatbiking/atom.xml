    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend the annual packraft gathering took place in southern Finland. Now third year in running, it pulled together around 15 paddlers over the course of the weekend, a highest number so far, with several first timers and lots of new faces. As opposed to <a href="http://leftbound.com/blog/2015/11/19/Packraft-Gathering/">last year&rsquo;s lake hopping in Helvetinjärvi National Park</a>, this time the event was kicked off in <a href="http://www.kytaja-usmi.fi">Kytäjä-Usmi</a> outdoor area in Hyvinkää, and took the colorful flock of paddlers down the river Vantaanjoki, all the way to Myllykoski, and a few, even beyond.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29838062175/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Colors of packrafting"><img src="https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8307/29838062175_c568bb7162_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Colors of packrafting"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Unfortunately, for me, come the week of the event, I managed to pull something on my left shoulder, playing sporty games at my daughter&rsquo;s school camp I was supervising, and had to make a tough call of bailing out from the longish paddled down the river, and simply join the kick-off at lake Piilolammi in Kytäjä-Usmi, to meet the fellow paddlers and to try catch some fish. Launch was preceded by a simple workshop we had put together with Marko, discussing the few intricacies of fishing from a packraft, and preparing simple line and a hook systems to use with earthworms or bait fish. Although lake offered no catch for the minimalist fishermen, a dark-hued pike was eventually caught in the group, and prepared by the fire.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29724989062/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Pikey dinner being prepared"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8514/29724989062_9a2d08e82e_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Pikey dinner being prepared"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Some of us, yours truly included, had relied on catching some protein from the lake, so the lone catch quickly disappeared from the pan, with some fried onion and chopped sheep polypore (&lsquo;lampaankääpä&rsquo;), harvested from the surrounding forest, as a side dish. I had mistakenly assumed there would be a lean-to at the lake, so without any shelter with me, I laid my sleeping bag by the fire, bivvying under the cloudy skies, perfectly warm and cozy through the relatively warm autumn night.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29838065235/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Journey begins"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8492/29838065235_2c880726a2_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1536" alt="Journey begins"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Next morning I tried again to catch some perch for breakfast but the lake, rich in humus, still provided none, so porridge it was. The merry team of packrafters then packed up, few heads stronger, and hit the road, hiking to a nearby tributary, for an early launch towards Vantaanjoki. Left behind by my own choise, I had opted to explore the area on a bike, and packing up with day&rsquo;s supplies and fishing gear, I hit the trails soon after, with a rough plan for a round trip through the forest roads and trails.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29755491901/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Faster!"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8345/29755491901_d55fccbeeb_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Faster!"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Day remained cloudy and comfortably cool, while I roamed in the park on my fatbike, visiting several lakes, including Mäkiperänlampi, Kiiskilampi, Iso Kypärä, Kaksoislammit and Usminjärvi. Of these, the middle three have a lean-to in them, and especially the ones in Kiiskilampi and Kaksoislammit are well positioned with great views. A smart approach in my opinion, the firewood supplies, which there are many, were always positioned some distance away from the lean-to&rsquo;s and fireplaces, requiring a bit of effort to keep the fire going.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29210839154/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Woody supply"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8393/29210839154_d3af583fba_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Woody supply"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Not so smart choice were the oddly sized lean-tos, sized to accommodate only three people at a time, with anyone over 160 cm tall having to sleep in parallel to the doorway, effectively blocking the way for others sharing the shelter. A 195 cm tall myself, it was not a match made in heaven, as head or feet first is generally the best way to share a lean-to shelter.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29545303730/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Too tall, or too small?"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8551/29545303730_7b91349198_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Too tall, or too small?"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I took my time to enjoy the views, to stop here and there, and of course to try catch some fish, as my lunch was mainly dependent on that. Lakes remained silent, which has to do with, if not only my luck, or skills, the specific time of the year and the northerly winds. Regardless, no protein from the lake, but I did have a few slices of buckwheat bread with garnish in my pack and shared a sausage by the fire at Iso Kypärä, offered by a friendly couple finishing up their lunch. If the nature does not provide, a kind passer-by just might! Though I did find some more mushrooms and of course plenty of harvest-ready lingonberries and some overdue bilberries.</p>

<p>The park had just recently received brand new sign-posts all around, which made it super easy to navigate through, with directions and distances carved in each colorful pole. These however were only along the gravel and forest roads, so once on the trails, a general sense of direction, and at times a map of the area, was needed for navigation.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29210829804/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="Signpost"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8270/29210829804_e08d19b26f_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="Signpost"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I finished my tour nearby lake Piilolammi, where my car was parked, and guestimating the group just might be done soon with their roughly 20 kilometers of paddling down the river, I deciced to, instead of heading directly home, visit them at the next stop, at Nukarinkoski rapids. Turning up around six in the evening to the lean-to, the group had indeed shortly arrived. Similar to few others joining the event, I hadn&rsquo;t had high expectations on the surroundings of Vantaanjoki, and having to skip the long paddle had not been a huge disappointment. However, as I got to hear around the camp fire, the river had an ace or two up in its sleeve, and the day had not only been a long strenuous paddle with a good mileage for slow packrafts, but spotted with interesting views and passing attractions.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29210838154/in/album-72157672979293280/" title="The nest"><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8531/29210838154_766373f1a8_k.jpg" width="2048" height="1365" alt="The nest"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>While the easy rapids down the line had been rock-hopping gardens due to very low water levels, and the big ones at Nukarinkoski (largest of them all along Vantaanjoki), and next day at Myllykoski, unpaddleable again due to insufficient discharge, they had made the days more interesting and also revealed some good potential for a revisit in the future. I bid farewell again to the team at the night fall, heading home with few others, while the remaining packrafters were looking forward to the next day&rsquo;s paddle.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Each time I visit family and relatives in Ostrobothnia, I try to reserve some time to head outdoors and visit interesting places hiking, paddling, cycling or whatever is appropriate for the given season. One of the gems I found this summer was the <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/lauhanvuori">Lauhanvuori National Park</a>, southwest of Kauhajoki, which I visited by bike in July.</p>

<p>Best known as having the highest &lsquo;mountain&rsquo; (a true mountain indeed in the scale of Ostrobothnia) in Western Finland, rising 231 meters above sea level, and of its ancient seashores, called &lsquo;kivijata&rsquo; or &lsquo;jata&rsquo;, this national park extends across roughly 54 square kilometers of hardwood forest with podsolic soil, with springs, ponds and small lakes to enjoy, and of course those aforementioned boulderfields and different types of bog.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29312007926/in/album-72157669993821174/" title="Ahvenlammi"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8399/29312007926_50da84139b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ahvenlammi"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Uncommon within the current 39 national parks in Finland, cycling on the trails is luckily not forbidden in this particular national park, but <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/lauhanvuori/aktiviteetit">cautiously encouraged</a> within the well-established (and sign-posted) network of trails. As several <a href="https://www.imba.com/resources/research/trail-science/environmental-impacts-mountain-biking-science-review-and-best-practices">studies have concluded</a>, mountain biking generally has an (environmental) impact that is less than or comparable to hiking, but one should still thread carefully to avoid any unnecessary conflicts. Bikepacking style of exploration though is less likely to cause friction. During my visit I had only positive encounters with hikers (while I saw no other cyclists), part of which might be due to riding a fatbike, part to my chatty personality, and the rest surely due to the merry folks of Ostrobothnia!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29058292300/in/album-72157669993821174/" title="Restored duckboards"><img src="https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8215/29058292300_6882c4acc0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Restored duckboards"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>During the day I was mostly alone, as I only met few hikers at the trailend and close to the central parking lot, not far from the lookout tower. Just a sample of one day over one weekend, I did have a short talk with a family, regular visitors themselves, who confirmed park really does not seem to get a whole lot visitors, outside of the parking lot surroundings - what a shame.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29266773181/in/album-72157669993821174/" title="Watchtower view"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8502/29266773181_08c92ce3a3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Watchtower view"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Spending a full day on the trail, from dawn till dusk, I got to cycle most of all rideable trails across the park, some 40+ kilometers in total, plus some on the gravel roads, connecting few trailheads. I did not carry a map of the area, but followed the generally well-marked trails and checked my bearings on the GPS, when I was not sure which direction best to take. In addition to marked routes leading to specific attraction or a vantage point, there are plenty of trails to go about and around, so that&rsquo;s exactly what I did.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29266787861/in/album-72157669993821174/" title="Line of sight"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8063/29266787861_03ce8877eb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Line of sight"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Taking my time to stop and enjoy the varied scenes, and to harvest an ample amount of billberies and raspberries as I came across good spots, I rode anything from overgrown forest roads (doubletracks really) and well maintained duckboards to technical single track and fast-paced trails. I was especially enchanted by the small sand-bottomed creeks, populated by brown trouts (fishing not permitted), with chrystal clear waters and mesmerizing views such as this churning sand in a tiny pond (video in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WleZAaZfcYQ">Youtube</a>):</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29266818301/in/album-72157669993821174/" title="Mesmerizing sand"><img src="https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8249/29266818301_ea1bbb2cf2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Mesmerizing sand"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Easiest trails were around the Lauhanvuori lookout tower and around the lake Spitaalijärvi and Kaivolammi pond, and heading southwest, kilometers long network of duckboards greets the visitor, providing access across bogs and into the boulderfields.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29345567745/in/album-72157669993821174/" title="Along a sandy river"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8503/29345567745_2f72068134_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Along a sandy river"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/28722537934/in/album-72157669993821174/" title="Long and windy road"><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8475/28722537934_1dfe7c7bd8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Long and windy road"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Towards west, around Lauhansarvi and Huhtakorpi is where I found the narrowest and most technical trails, and also some, hopefully about to be restored, broken down duckboards, before arriving to Ahvenlammi pond. There are few springs in the park, to quench your thirst in - I filled my reserves in Huhtakorpi spring.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/29266838321/in/album-72157669993821174/" title="Quenching the thirst"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8385/29266838321_a551393bf2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Quenching the thirst"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Ahvenlammi used to be the camping spot north of the area, a serene mire of a lake, but the fireplace there is about to be torn down, and new site established at another pond, aforementioned Kaivolammi. As the fireplace was still intact, with a poster informing about the upcoming change, I had my dinner there, before continuing my circle around the park as the sun was setting, and to have a post-ride dip in the Spitaalijärvi (&lsquo;Leprocy Lake&rsquo;). Lake Spitaalijärvi is an acidic lake with pH as low as 4.7, with presumed healing properties - hence the name.</p>

<p>A great long day on a bike, glad I picked this one up for one of the summer outings and I highly recommend it for a daytrip or an overnighter on a bike. Map of the area and some other vital pieces of information can be found <a href="http://www.luontoon.fi/lauhanvuori">here</a>. Similar to few other destinations in this area I&rsquo;ve visited in the past (<a href="http://leftbound.com/blog/2014/04/23/Suupohja-Sample/">1</a>, <a href="http://leftbound.com/blog/2015/04/07/Nuijapoloku/">2</a>), also this one is featured in the <a href="http://www.seikkailesuupohjassa.fi/en">Seikkaile Suupohjassa</a> -resource, maintained by <a href="http://www.suupohjankehittamisyhdistys.fi">Suupohja Development Association</a> (Suupohjan Kehittämisyhdistys ry).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I was supposed to join a few paddlers to explore the <a href="http://kansalaisen.karttapaikka.fi/kartanhaku/osoitehaku.html?x=363295&amp;y=6697156&amp;srs=EPSG:3067&amp;text=H%C3%A4rk%C3%A4l%C3%A4njoen+aloituspaikka&amp;scale=16000&amp;action=link&amp;mode=&amp;lang=fi">Härkälänjoki</a> river, which would have also been the season&rsquo;s opening for me. But unexpected duties called and I had to bail out at the last minute. Others went, read about the wallow'y paddle in <a href="https://avisuora.wordpress.com/2015/03/28/melontaa-ja-rypemista-harkalanjoessa-28-3-2015/">Janne&rsquo;s blog</a> (in Finnish).</p>

<p>Vexed, spending most of Saturday indoors (weather was pretty miserable, so not a huge loss though), come Sunday I packed the bike and hit the road. Decided against paddling, traditional season&rsquo;s opening in Espoonjoki river can wait, I rode to Kirkkonummi to cycle around lake Meiko.</p>

<p>Meiko is a nice wilderness area and, being just some 20 kilometers away, one of my regular destinations, be it for hiking, paddling or cycling. Despite visiting the area many times, many of the trails covered, I had never completed a full roundtrip around the meandering lake. I knew that the south side of the lake would be rather technical and tricky to cycle, and my bike loaded up with some bare essentials for a day out, I expected to push the bike quite a bit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/sets/72157649311720663/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7585/16782556229_89d291d29d_c.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Once I arrived to the outdoor area, I headed to the Korsolampi fireplace to collect some sticks and twigs for my Bushbuddy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/sets/72157649311720663/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7628/16781277550_67562d0285_c.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I circled the lake clockwise, and as it turned out, the trail, mostly following the shoreline, was not overly difficult. At the end of the day I estimated that I probably rode about 90 percent of it. Some pushing and pulling, and lifting the bike over random obstacles such as fallen trees was perfectly acceptable.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonipalomaki/sets/72157649311720663/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7604/16782557229_de77659be6_c.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I enjoyed a long lunch on top of a cliff on the south side of the lake, with a view, and despite the gloomy skies not a drop of rain fell, and even sun peeped out when I was cycling back home. Yet another fun day out in Meiko, maybe next time the ice will all be gone, and it&rsquo;s time to pull out the packraft and start catching some fish!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having a business meeting in <a href="http://www.tampere.fi/english/index.html">Tampere</a> yesterday, I dediced to take an opportunity to try and visit some of the outdoor areas nearby. Browsing around, I was contemplating between cycling and packrafting, or combining both, but eventually ended up just bringing the bike, and choosing the destinations accordingly. Out of the available options Kytäjä-Usmi and Evo outdoor areas turned up as favorites, despite the lousy weather forecast for the day.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/13958262289_fac10493b0_o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Starting very early from Espoo, and arrived to one of the parking lots at the <a href="http://kytaja-usmi.fi/">Kytäjä-Usmi outdoor area</a>, nearby lake Usminjärvi. It had been pouring all the way there, but by chance not a drop of rain fell when I unloaded the bike and packed it with basic gear - plan was to have a warm breakfast somewhere on the trail. When browsing the map for a route, sky opened as forecasted and it started raining sleet. Merrily I took a direction towards Kaksoislammit lean-to, following the signposts available along the gravel roads entering the park.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5558/13958261999_585b2222ed_b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/14121746046_fe48927dbf_b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2916/14144931625_8b3efd67a0_b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This was my first visit to this area (which is also part of Natura 2000 network), except for the days I&rsquo;ve spent climbing in <a href="http://27crags.com/crags/jaanankallio">Jaanankallio</a> in the past, southwest from the area I was now cycling in. During the two-hour ride, including tracking back my steps to search for a pair of rain gloves I dropped (found them!), I toured east from Piilolammi and Iso Kypärä lakes, and found good sections of varying single track - plus some proper bushwhacking and bike-carrying terrain, but that&rsquo;s bound to happen when you are trying figure out where the good ones are. Rain never stopped, but just the quantity and consistency of sleet was alternating, at times being almost, but not quite, like snow. But great views (small ponds and lakes, bogs, rock cliffs and an old quarry) all around nevertheless.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7342/14145118114_d2d8c51149_b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7382/14121746406_d200456a51_b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Finishing the ride, I headed towards Tampere, taking a shower (and dipping in the pool) in <a href="http://www.tampere.fi/liikuntajavapaaaika/liikuntajaulkoilu/uimahallit/hervanta.html">Hervanta swimming hall</a>, amidst the handful of senior citizens doing water aerobics and deep water running in the otherwise empty hall. It was great to head to the office refreshed!</p>

<p>After work and an early dinner, it was time to start the journey towards <a href="http://www.outdoors.fi/evo">Evo</a> for an overnighter. Not exactly on the road back home, it&rsquo;s still a reasonable detour diverting from Hämeenlinna and a place I&rsquo;ve had on the to-do list for a while. I knew a group of packrafters, led by Pekka from <a href="http://reppulautta.blogspot.fi/">reppulautta.com</a> were starting their 3-night paddle across the park, and hoped to catch up with them someplace on the trail.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7355/14145118254_edef7dd7fe_o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Evo, a typical watershed region, is one of the largest continuous forested areas in southern Finland, of which some 47 sq.km is mapped as a hiking area. Splattered with small ponds and lakes and meandering rivers, it&rsquo;s a great spot for packrafting. And due to good network of forest roads, it&rsquo;s also well suited for bikerafting, allowing round trips across the whole area. Not to mention the possibilities for hiking and mountain biking. A good visual overview of the area (including shelters and camp sites) can be found <a href="http://julkaisut.metsa.fi/assets/pdf/lp/Esitteet/evofin.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Arriving quite late, I parked the car on the northeast corner, at lake Iso-Tarus, and loading up the bike again, headed to Nuijamiehenkolo lean-to. Riding on the gravel roads, and sections of single track and few dead ends (while the constant rain kept it fresh), led me there, to find Pekka&rsquo;s group settled for the night in tents. Before settling in myself for the night in the lean-to (no bugs yet = no tent for me), I did a bit of touring around the surrounding lakes and ponds (and sadly some clean-cut areas), finding wide range of trails and single track (while the typical ride-lift-ride-carry-ride-push-ride sequence prevailed).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7417/14142036702_e8a4e97e47_b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Back at the camp, it was time for dinner with an experimental dessert and a good chat around the fire. Exchanging tips and information especially about packrafting destinations, I got some ideas how to use up some of my future weekends inside the rubber dinghy with and/or without a bike.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5441/13958244327_b26328b129_o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Morning arrived with a very early wake up call and a quick breakfast, before finding a new route back to the car (through some of the trails I missed on the way there) with full day at work ahead back in Espoo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7344/14144931835_0f94ca0578_b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Though relatively superficial, it was great to have an opportunity to visit these two outdoor areas, and once the next time comes, it will be easier to make plans knowing already somewhat what to expect. Not too bad business trip giveaway!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Original plan to cycle through the <a href="http://www.mantyharju-repovesi.com/">newly established mountain bike trail</a> between Mäntyharju and Repovesi National Park over the last weekend got postponed (to very near future I hope), and instead a train-assisted bikepacking tour in Raseborg was chosen. I had shortlisted some interesting spots around <a href="http://www.visitraseborg.com/en?view=category&amp;id=81&amp;layout=box">Raseborg</a> region earlier, so I pulled that out to make a rough plan for an overnighter, and got a friend interested enough to tag along.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/sets/72157644120241190/"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2903/14136822013_3755ba0efb_o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>First leg was by train from Espoo to <a href="http://lappohja.com/">Lappohja</a>, with three different types of train (including one of those <a href="http://www.4rail.net/reference_finland_emus_sm4.php">cute bus-like regional trains</a>). I had followed the mixed weather forecast keenly, but despite the short shower while cycling to Kauklahti railway station (and a brief flurry of hail that followed) sun kept shining between the clouds while we placed the bikes next to the bicycle racks in the InterCity train. Old VR cars are so much better for transporting bikes - fatbike does not even fit to the over-engineered bike hangers in the newer trains. And it&rsquo;s a tight fit for any three bikes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/sets/72157644120241190/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7453/13930140908_d3dedea9d4_b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Arriving to destination, we rode to the <a href="http://www.uudenmaanvirkistysalueyhdistys.fi/index.php?k=13408">Lappohjanranta</a>, a shoaled bay of fine sand over a kilometer wide, with views to the sea from the timbered dunes, protected from wear and tear by a fence that routes visitors through the wooden stairways.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/sets/72157644120241190/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5038/14113475821_ac3cd84579_b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Wind on our back, and picking up, we biked across the beach and started heading towards <a href="http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammisaari">Tammisaari</a>, some 18 kilometers away. Following mainly the coast line, we found sections of nice single track here and there, disconnected by lengths of gravel roads and tarmac. After stopping for some ice cream and cake in Villa Kosthåll at Skogsby and passing wartime front lines with tank barriers, next target was the <a href="http://www.loydalahde.com/dagmarin-lahde-raasepori/">Dagmar spring</a> - perfect spot for a refreshing refill, while locals were hauling large water containers along the trail (it&rsquo;s a short walk from the parking lot).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/sets/72157644120241190/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7057/14117111204_196118e466_o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>We had been pushing the rain clouds ahead of us, but as it now looked like the weather would finally close in, we continued quickly to Tammisaari downtown, to buy some fresh food for the evening. My rough plan had pinpointed few lean-to&rsquo;s in the <a href="http://www.raasepori.fi/palvelut/liikunta/friluftsomraden/vasterby-friluftsomrade">Västerby outdoor area</a> northwest from Tammisaari, and with the weather clearing again in front of us, we entered the gravel roads and the network of well-marked trails.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/sets/72157644120241190/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5280/13930127850_4f1c41f746_o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://www.raasepori.fi/dokument/doc_download/668-vasterby-friluftsomrade">PDF map</a> found under the link above, we cycled first to lake Västerby Storträsket (and the lean-to there), and continued then towards lake Långträsket. Passing two other lean-to&rsquo;s, we reached the southern tip of lake Grabbskog Storträsket, and found yet another lean-to on the edge of the lake, quickly agreeing it was the nicest of the ones seen, and perfect spot for the night. Odometer showed <a href="http://www.movescount.com/moves/move31020453">good 40 kilometers</a> of riding for the day, and we were ready for the dinner feast and ride backwash.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/67976808@N06/sets/72157644120241190/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7418/13930127520_6d05983b9b_b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Night was peaceful, with a soundtrack of wind calming down, overdue downpour at night and early morning trumpets of passing Mute Swans and chatter of Black Grouse from the distant bog. With an early train to catch from Tammisaari, we packed up after a quick breakfast around eight in the morning, and followed trails and gravel roads back to tarmac. After some eight kilometers, we reached the railway station to hitch the ride back home with the same combination of trains (at a moderate price of 15 EUR with a bike).</p>

<p>Great little outing in a new area, and definitely will pay it another visit at some point, as there&rsquo;s still a lot more ground to cover, trails to ride. And the bike worked like a charm except for the odd case of faulty chain rollers that required some roadside maintenance (and visit to Velosport this week for warranty replacements). I used a setup I tested earlier last week, riding without a backpack, and it worked well, including the large(ish) 22 liter Ortlieb PS10 dry sack strapped to the <a href="https://www.revelatedesigns.com/index.cfm/store.catalog/Handle-Bar/Harness-handlebar-harness-sling-">harness</a> on the handlebar.</p>
